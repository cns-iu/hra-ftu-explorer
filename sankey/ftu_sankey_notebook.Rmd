## Load libraries

```{r load libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Load data

We need the `sankey.csv` file to then preprocess it into nodes and links.

```{r load data}
sankey = read_csv("../ref_data/sankey.csv", quote = "\'")
```


```{r}

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
